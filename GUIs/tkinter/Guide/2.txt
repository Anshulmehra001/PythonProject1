The game acts as a standalone installment in the wider Call of Duty franchise in lieu of the World War II,Black Ops and Modern Warfare series that preceded it.Ghosts inherits much of the core gameplay and structure of previous titles,with a mission-based campaign and an open-ended multiplayer,but introduces a near-future setting to the series as well as an increased focus on tactical gameplay,including the addition of new "Squads" modes and orbital strike superweapons to the multiplayer.Ghosts also features an alternative co-operative shooter mode titled Extinction,acting as a spiritual successor to the Zombies co-operative PvE gamemodes introduced to the franchise in Call of Duty:
World at War.
